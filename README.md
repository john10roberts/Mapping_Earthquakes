 Mapping_Earthquakes

  ## Overview of Project
Stakeholders would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.

### Summary
The request has been completed using leaflet, JavaScript, and HTML to map the earthquake data requested. We wrote a script to pull GeoJSON data from the USGS website, which gives us all the relevant earthquake data. Earthquakes will show as colored circles with the size and the color of the circle determined by the magnitude of the earthquake. Clicking on a circle will show the location and the exact magnitude of the earthquake. Users will have the option to add or remove layers to see the information that is most relevant to them.
